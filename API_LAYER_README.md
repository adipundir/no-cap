# 🚀 No-Cap Facts API Layer: A Developer's Knowledge Graph

## Vision

Transform verified facts stored on Walrus into a powerful, accessible knowledge graph that developers can integrate into any application. Create the **world's first decentralized fact-checking API** where every piece of information is cryptographically verifiable and permanently stored.

## The Big Idea

Instead of facts living in silos, we're building **infrastructure for truth** - an API layer that makes verified knowledge as easy to access as any web service, but with the permanence and verifiability of blockchain storage.

### What Makes This Special

🔐 **Cryptographically Verifiable**: Every fact is stored on Walrus with content hashes  
🏷️ **Rich Tagging System**: AI-powered categorization with human curation  
📊 **Real-time Analytics**: Track verification trends and topic popularity  
⚡ **Developer-First**: RESTful APIs, SDKs, webhooks, and comprehensive docs  
🌍 **Global Access**: Free tier for developers, enterprise features for scale  
🔍 **Semantic Search**: Find facts by meaning, not just keywords

Every fact in our system is:
- ✅ **Verified** by multiple independent sources
- 🔗 **Linked** to original sources and evidence  
- 🏷️ **Tagged** for easy discovery and categorization
- 🔒 **Immutable** via cryptographic storage on Walrus
- 📊 **Trackable** with full verification history

### The Future of Knowledge

We're building infrastructure for the **post-misinformation world** - where accessing verified information is as simple as making an API call, but the verification is cryptographically guaranteed and permanently auditable.
