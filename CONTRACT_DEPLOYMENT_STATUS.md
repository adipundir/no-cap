# Contract Deployment Status

## Current Status: ❌ NOT DEPLOYED

Your smart contracts are not yet deployed to World Chain mainnet. This is why you're seeing the "Verification Error" in the app.

## Environment Configuration

Add this to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Contract Deployment Status
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACTS_DEPLOYED=false
```

## What's Happening

1. **Wallet Connection**: ✅ Working (using MiniKit SDK)
2. **World ID Verification**: ✅ Working (proof of humanhood)
3. **On-Chain Submission**: ❌ Failing (contracts not deployed)

## The Error You're Seeing

The error "Auto-verification failed" occurs because:
- Your app tries to submit the World ID proof to the smart contract
- But the contract address is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
- This causes the blockchain transaction to fail

## Solution

### Option 1: Deploy Contracts (Recommended)
1. Deploy `NOCAPWalrusHybrid.sol` to World Chain mainnet
2. Update contract addresses in `lib/unified-contracts.ts`
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACTS_DEPLOYED=true`

### Option 2: Disable Auto-Verification (Temporary)
The app now checks `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACTS_DEPLOYED` and skips verification if contracts aren't ready.

## Proof of Humanhood Status

**✅ YES, you are doing proof of humanhood correctly!**

Your implementation uses:
- **World ID Orb verification** (highest security level)
- **MiniKit SDK** (native World App integration)
- **Nullifier hash uniqueness** (ensures one-time verification per human)
- **Signal binding** (ties proof to wallet address)

The verification **works** - it's just the on-chain storage that fails due to missing contracts.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy contracts** to World Chain mainnet
2. **Update contract addresses** in the code
3. **Set environment flag** to enable auto-verification
4. **Test full flow** from wallet connection to on-chain verification

## Verification Flow (When Contracts Are Deployed)

```
1. User clicks "Sign In" 
   ↓
2. Wallet authentication (MiniKit)
   ↓
3. Auto-check: Already verified?
   ↓
4. World ID verification (proof of humanhood)
   ↓
5. On-chain submission (smart contract)
   ↓
6. Success: User is verified human ✅
```

The system is designed to verify **only once per human** using World ID's nullifier hash system.
